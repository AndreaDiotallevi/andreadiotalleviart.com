</figcaption>

Last month I partecipated for the first time in <a href="https://genuary.art/" target="_blank">Genuary</a>, "_an artificially generated month of time where we build code that makes beautiful things_".

I have always been interested in creative processes and the mental models that are involved with it. So, this year I have finally committed to it and completed all the prompts for each day.

It was a fun, rewarding and challenging experience from which I have learnt a lot about myself and the act of creating something new with limited time and out of comfort zone.

This post has the objective to describe more extensively reflections I have had during this journey both for myself and for other members of the community that might find this inspiring.
