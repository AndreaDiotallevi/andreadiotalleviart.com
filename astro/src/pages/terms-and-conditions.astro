                <p class="mb-2">
                    I sell giclée fine-art prints. Prices are shown in the selected currency (e.g. GBP) and include
                    carbon-neutral shipping where stated. I reserve the right to correct pricing errors and to change
                    prices; if an error affects your order, I will contact you before taking payment or fulfilling it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Product images are representative; actual prints may vary slightly in colour due to screens and printing.

                <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Orders and payment</h2>
                <p class="mb-2">
                    When you place an order, you are making an offer to buy. I accept payment via Stripe (card and other
                    methods offered at checkout). Payment is taken at checkout. I will confirm your order by email. I may
                    refuse or cancel an order (e.g. if the product is unavailable, or in case of suspected fraud or error).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do not store your card details; payment is processed securely by Stripe. Your use of the site and
                    checkout is also subject to Stripe's terms where applicable.

                <h2 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Shipping and delivery</h2>
                <p>
                    Delivery times are indicative (e.g. 1–2 weeks within the UK, 2–3 weeks internationally). I am not
                    liable for delays caused by carriers or customs. Risk in the goods passes to you on delivery. You are
                    responsible for providing a correct delivery address; I cannot be held responsible for orders lost or
                    misdelivered due to incorrect details.
