                    <p>Welcome to my website.</p>
                    <p>Each piece begins as an idea and a set of rules — an algorithm shaped through hours of trial, error, and conversation with the machine. I never fully know where it will lead. The code surprises me, I respond, and together we iterate until something unexpected and beautiful appears.</p>
                    <p>For years, these works lived only on a screen. Recently, I decided to give them a physical form and built this space to share them as prints.</p>
                    <p>Not every piece becomes a print. Only a curated selection is released.</p>
                    <p>Each available work is produced using a high-quality fine art printing process, on soft, textured cotton paper, chosen to bring out depth, detail, and subtle color. In this form, the work sits at the intersection of engineering and artistic beauty — where code becomes something you can hold.</p>
                    <p>Find one you love.</p>
