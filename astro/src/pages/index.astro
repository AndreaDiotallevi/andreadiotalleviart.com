                        Welcome — you're exploring the work of Andrea Diotallevi, a <strong>generative artist and creative coder</strong> in London.
                        If you're curious about how images can emerge from code, you're in the right place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The work lives between <em>human intuition and machine behaviour</em>. I set clear rules, watch patterns emerge, and refine until colour,
                        rhythm and movement feel right.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Selected pieces are available as <strong>museum-quality giclée generative art prints</strong>,
                        with <strong>free carbon-neutral shipping</strong>. Explore the shop to find one you love.
                    </p>
