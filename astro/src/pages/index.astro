                    <p>Welcome!</p>
                    <p>This is art made with code.</p>
                    <p>Each piece begins as an idea and a set of rules — an algorithm I shape through hours of trial, error, and conversation with the machine. I never fully know where it will lead. The code surprises me, I respond, and together we iterate until something unexpected and beautiful appears.</p>
                    <p>For years, these works lived only on a screen. Recently, I decided to give them a physical form and built this space to share them as prints.</p>
                    <p>Not every piece becomes a print.</p>
                    <p>Only a curated selection is released.</p>
                    <p>Each available work is printed using a high-quality fine art process, on soft, textured cotton paper, chosen to bring out depth, detail, and subtle color. These prints are made to last and to be experienced up close.</p>
                    <p>Why prints?</p>
                    <p>Because for a long time, when I said “I write code and make images,” it didn’t quite land — even with my parents. But the moment they held one of these works in their hands, something shifted. It became real. They were excited. They finally understood.</p>
                    <p>These prints sit at the intersection of engineering and artistic beauty — where code turns into something you can hold.</p>
                    <p>Explore prints.</p>
