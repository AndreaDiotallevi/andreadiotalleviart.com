                My name is Andrea Diotallevi. I am a generative artist and
                creative coder based in London.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                As a pianist and former architect, I am fascinated by the
                intersection between art and technology and I am in constant
                exploration of generative art concepts.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                For each new work, I design a custom algorithm capable of
                generating a sequence of unique but aesthetically related
                images.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Selected artworks are available as <strong>giclée fine art prints</strong> in the <a href="/shop" class="underline">shop</a>. Prints are produced on <strong>Hahnemühle Photo Rag 308&nbsp;gsm</strong> using <strong>museum‑quality archival inks</strong> for exceptional detail and longevity.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Each print is full‑bleed with no border and is offered in sizes that complement the composition (for example, A3 or 50&nbsp;×&nbsp;70&nbsp;cm depending on the artwork). <strong>Carbon‑neutral shipping</strong> is included at no extra cost; delivery times are typically 1–2&nbsp;weeks within the UK and 2–3&nbsp;weeks internationally. See the <a href="/return-policy" class="underline">returns policy</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
